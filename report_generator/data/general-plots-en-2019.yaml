      Dear sponsor,
      </p>
      
      <p>
      PyCon TW 2019 had an exciting and fulfilling time because of your help. This year, 
      we provided more than 7000 USD financial aid to engage a wider communities. 
      For example, people who have significantly contributed to the Python communities, 
      or people and students who are not able to attend due to economic considerations. 
      This greatly enhanced our community diversity. This became possible only because of you, 
      our sponsors.
      </p>
      <p>
      This year, we have in total 675 python enthusiast who joined us at glamorous hall at the 
      Humanities and Social Science Building (HSSB), Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. This year, 
      108 brilliant talks were shared with the participants, this was strictly selected from all 
      submitted talks. The acceptance rate of proposal is 38.5%. We also invited four world-renowned
      speakers from around the world. All the talks are published on youtube. You could find them in 
      the following link:

- Title_Categories:
  - represent: barchart
  - description: >-
      The mainstream attendees are engineers. However we also have other people with different 
      job titles, including management, C-level (CTO, CEO etc. We mark it as "Head") and students. 
      If the attendee did not specify or refused to tell, they are categorized as 
      "potential job seeker."
- Nationality:
  - represent: barchart
  - description: >-
      In PyCon TW 2019, 80% of the attendees are Taiwanese. 
      There were also a significant amount of foreigners (50 people, 7.5%.) 
      Among all the talks, there were {50%} talks given in English language, 
      and {50%} talks with English subtitle. This allows a great opportunities for 
      english-speakers to enjoy the conference. At the same time,  enhance immediate 
      knowledge exchange across sea and borders. 
- Seniority:
  - represent: barchart
  - description: >-
      Most of the attendees are intermediate level python users/developers. 
      ( 1 to 5 years experience in python scripting.) It is a great opportunity 
      for companies to recruit potential enthusiastic developer who are willing 
      to participate in the event and enhance their knowledge and abilities. 
- Interested_Field:
  - represent: barchart
  - description: >-
        The top seven popular topics among attendees are “AI and machine learning”, 
        “web technology”, “Engineering and Mathematics”, “Science”, “Technology”, 
        and “DevOps.” This ranking is approximately reflecting the topics of the 
        talks in the conference. “AI and machine learning” remains as the top one 
        hot topic since {which year}. We also see a great portion of people showed 
        interests in engineering, mathematics and science. The statistics is based 
        on a multiple-choice question. 

      The trend is explicit to show the mainstream field: AI and machine learning.
      Science is more than DevOps. This is a little bit unexpectedly.

        As a Python conference, we aim to contribute not only to attendee’s interested 
        fields, but also to core python language itself. As a result, the three 
        main topics are “Python best practice and patterns,” “Data analysis,” 
        and “Science.” We also try to keep the topic as diverse as possible. You could 
        observe from the pie chart above that there are in total 25 categories covered.
